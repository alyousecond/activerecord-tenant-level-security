## v0.2.0 (2023-04-14)

This release includes changes to policies created by `create_policy`. Migrations that have already been performed will not be affected, so it is safe to upgrade as-is, but for performance reasons it is recommended to update existing policies to the new format. See https://github.com/kufu/activerecord-tenant-level-security/pull/16 for details.
